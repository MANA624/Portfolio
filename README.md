# Welcome! #

Hello, and thank you for your interest in my portfolio page! The idea of this page is to highlight some of my proudest programming assignments I've done in my career so far. I'm in the process of adding many of my more important school and personal projects to the repository, but please feel free to look at what I have here! 9/30/19

# Other Repos of Interest #

Sometimes my work is done in a separate GitHub repository. Rather than placing one repo in the other, I've chosen to provide links to them here.

* [Click here](https://github.com/MANA624/therealpi "The Real Pi GitHub") (last updated Fall '19) for the source to my personal web site, [therealpi.net](https://therealpi.net "The Real Pi Link"). To log in, use the following credentials: username: `employer` and password: `hireme123`. Please take a look at what I've done to demonstrate my ability to create, maintain, and defend a full-stack application. From installing certificates to sanitizing user input to hashing passwords, I've personally implemented the common security techniques that keep a system safe. There are more technical specs on the site, but I personally wrote and set up everything on a Raspberry Pi in my room. It's my largest fun personal hobby, and it has some utility.
* [Command-Line Chess](https://github.com/MANA624/OOAD-Project "OOAD GitHub") (Spring '19) is a scalable Java application that allows users to enter chess moves using algebraic notation and checks the validity of the user's move. The idea was to program a dynamic backend with an MVP framework in that can handle the complexities of the rules of chess. This was my final project for Object-Oriented Analysis and Design. I worked with a partner, but I enjoyed working on it so much I really dominated the work (the workload was fair and agreed-upon). This is my most organized Java project, and I really hope to come back to it some day and create some more features, because the code would be very easy to scale and contribute to. Score: 100%

# A Note On Projects in This Repo #

Below is a brief description on each of the projects that are here in the Portfolio repository. These are school projects when noted and projects I did for fun when not.

* Averager (last updated Spring '17) is a dynamic Python GUI that averages school grades. It was one of my first projects I did when I started programming, though I've refactored and enhanced it a couple of times since then. It came from a time when I didn't really know what to do as a programmer and figured everything would end up in a GUI. So I wrote a Python application to keep track of my grades and calculate them so I didn't have to spend so much time doing the tedious things during the semester. It also manages those pesky syllabi you can never seem to find...
* Proc (Fall '18) was an assignment from CSCI 5573, Advanced Operating Systems. The point of the assignment was to go into the /proc file system in Linux and learn all about memory management and the structure of process memory. I also got to edit the stack with another program with root access to show what one can do with root access. The problem statement and materials provided are in Description.pdf. My solution and screenshots are demonstrated in Solution.pdf. Source code is also provided. Score: 100%
* Rootkit (Fall '18) was another assignmnet from CSCI 5573, Advanced Operating Systems. The project was creating an LKM rootkit that hides certain files from `ls` by intercepting the `getdents()` system call and replacing it with my own wrapper. Then I wrote a counter-measure to this by writing another LKM that saves the sytem call table, then compares it with what it finds later. Finally, I wrote another version of the rootkit that defeats this counter-measure. This is one of my favorite assignments I've done to date. Description.pdf tells a wonderful story about LKMs, syscalls, memory, processes, and so much more. The source code, Makefiles, and all material used are in the numbered files - each file corresponds to a part of the assignment. Score: 100%
* therealpi.co.nf (last updated ~2016) was therealpi.net before I actually knew anything about programming. I keep this here more for historical purposes and highlighting progress rather than ability.
