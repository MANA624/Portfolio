# Welcome! #

Hello, and thank you for your interest in my portfolio page! Unfortunately, you might see very quickly that it is extremely out of date. This is for a few reasons, but none of which are very good. Anyways, I'm currently in the process of including some various other projects in this portfolio so that I'll actually have something to display. 9/23/19

# Other Repos of Interest #

Sometimes my work is done in a separate GitHub repository. Rather than placing one in the other, I've chosen to provide links to them here.

* [Click here](https://github.com/MANA624/therealpi "The Real Pi GitHub") for the source to my personal web site, [therealpi.net](https://therealpi.net "The Real Pi Link"). Please take a look! To log in, use the following credentials: username: `employer` and password: `hireme123`. There are more technical specs on the site, but it is all home-grown. It's my largest fun personal hobby with some utility.
* [Command-Line Chess](https://github.com/MANA624/OOAD-Project "OOAD GitHub") is the source for my final project for Object-Oriented Analysis and Design. I worked with a partner, but I enjoyed working on it so much I really dominated the work (the workload was fair and agreed-upon). The idea was to program a well-written backend interface with an MVP framework in that can handle the complexities of the rules of chess. This is my most organized Java project, and I really hope to come back to it some day and create some more features, because the code would be very easy to scale and contribute to.

# A Note On Projects in This Repo #

Below is a brief description on each of the projects that are here in the Portfolio repository.

* Averager (very creatively named) is a GUI that averages school grades. It was one of my first projects I did when I started programming, though I've refactored and enhanced it a couple of times since then. It came from a time when I didn't really know what to do as a programmer and figured everything would end up in a GUI. So I wrote a Python application to keep track of my grades and calculate them so I didn't have to spend so much time doing the tedious things during the semester. It also manages those pesky syllabi you can never seem to find...
