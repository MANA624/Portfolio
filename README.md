# Welcome! #

Hello, and thank you for your interest in my portfolio page! Unfortunately, you might see very quickly that it is extremely out of date. This is for a few reasons, but none of which are very good. Anyways, I'm currently in the process of including some various other projects in this portfolio so that I'll actually have something to display. 9/23/19

# Other Repos of Interest #

Sometimes my work is done in a separate GitHub repository. Rather than placing one in the other, I've chosen to provide links to them here.

* [Click here](https://github.com/MANA624/therealpi "The Real Pi GitHub") for the source to my personal web site, [therealpi.net](https://therealpi.net "The Real Pi Link"). Please take a look! To log in, use the following credentials: username: `employer` and password: `hireme123`. There are more technical specs on the site, but it is all home-grown. It's my largest fun personal hobby with some utility.
