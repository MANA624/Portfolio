Programming Assignment 2
=======================


This is a web server written by Matthew Niemiec
It takes no command-line arguments

It accepts POST requests, as shown in the extra credit portion of the assignment
For POST requests, it takes all data after the first empty line, and puts it in between the appropriate tags just after the <head> tag in the html

The HTTP 1.1 extra credit was not implemented

When accepting a new connection, the program calls fork() and creates a new child process to handle the request, enabling simultaneous access to the site
These children are reaped when they finish execution in intHandler()
Likewise, the program exits gracefully after closing the socket in intHandler()

The proram reads in all data from wf.conf and stores this data in the cf struct in the populateConfig() function
When sending headers, this is referenced to get the Content Type to put in the header in getContentType()
There is other info in this struct, such as the port number, the location of error files, the document root, and the name of the index.html file

When asking for a file that this program doesn't have, it will return a 404 Not Found error page
When using a protocol other than GET or POST, it will return a 501 Not Implemented error page
