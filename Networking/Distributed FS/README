Programming Assignment 3 - Distributed File System.

--------------------------------------------------------
This assignment contains:
1) Two code files:
 	1. DFC.c - contains code for distributed file client
	2. DFS.c - contains code for distributed file server

2) Four config files:
	1. dfs.conf - config file containing all valid usernames and passwords for server
	2. dfc1.conf - valid config file containing a correct username/password and other info for client
	3. dfc2.conf - Same as dfc1, but with different username and password
	4. dfcx.conf - Valid client config file, but with invalid username/password combo

3) Two server scripts:
	1. runall.sh - Run ./runall.sh to start all DFS servers
	2. killall.sh - Run ./killall.sh to kill -9 all DFS servers

4) Three sample text files:
	1. works1.txt - contains numbers 1 to 4
	2. works2.txt - contains numbers 1 to 23
	3. works3.txt - contains 69141 bytes of pure gibberish for a large text file

5) Three sample images:
	1. smaller.jpg - Very small jpg file for testing sending small binary data
	2. small.png - Slightly larger png file for testing sending average biinary data
	3. huge.png - Much larger png file of 66413 bytes for large binary data

6) One Makefile:
	1. type `make` to compile all code and `make clean` to remove executables

---------------------------------------------------------------
Upon running, this program will make 5 directories of two types:
	1. DFS1/, DFS2/, DFS3/, and DFS4/ are all directories created by DFS
	2. downloads/ is a directory where `get` files are stored by the DFC

---------------------------------------------------------------
To run program, do the following:
	1. In one terminal, type `make`
	2. Then type `./runall.sh`
	3. In another terminal, type `./DFC dfc?.conf` where ? is replaced by the config file specified
	4. Begin entering `put <file>`, `get <file>`, or `ls`
